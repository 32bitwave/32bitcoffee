A 555 timer put in an astable mode creates a SQUARE wave for applications like audio, pulsing, or clock signals.

How it works:
* A capacitor charges through resistors you choose
* Then the discharge pin on the 555 timer becomes active
* The capacitor discharges through the discharge pin

Bill of materials:
* 1 X Breadboard
* 2 X 10uf Capacitors (Be aware of polarity!)
* 2 X 1K Resistors
* 1 X LED
* 1 X 555 Timer IC
* 1 X 10K Potentiometer
* 1 X 9V battery (any power supply 9V to 12V)
* 1 X Set of wires for breadboard

Tips:
* Red on the breadboard is positive, Blue on the breadboard is negative.
* You may not be able to see it, but the top left pin (pin8) of the 555 timer is connected to the positive rail.
* Take note of the polarity of your capacitors and which rail on the breadboard you have positive and negative voltages connected to.
* Take note of the polarity of your LED.

Twist the knob of the Potentiometer and watch the LED blink using square waves!
