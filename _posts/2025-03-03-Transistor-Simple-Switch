Transistors in its simplest terms amplifies or switches electrical signals. In these examples, a BJT 2N2222 transistor will be used to switch on and off power to an LED.

How it works:
* A low power source, such as an Arduino pin or low voltage, is applied to the "Base"
* Electricity flows from "Collector" to "Emitter"

Here is a diagram of transistor we will use:

Bill of materials:
* 1 X Breadboard
* 2 X 10uf Capacitors (Be aware of polarity!)
* 2 X 1K Resistors
* 1 X LED
* 1 X 555 Timer IC
* 1 X 10K Potentiometer
* 1 X 9V battery (any power supply 9V to 12V)
* 1 X Set of wires for breadboard
